## Professional Experience
My research mostly focuses on microbiome studies. More specifically, I conduct methodological research aiming to develop more accurate and powerful statistical models for microbiome data analysis. With Dr. Ni Zhao, an associate professor in the department, I have worked on a few projects including "Differential Analysis through Proportional Hazards Model", "Reliability and Effectiveness of Microbiome Rarefaction", and "Longitudinal Analysis of Microbiome Data via Tensor Decomposition".

## Personal Life
I particularly enjoy music, especially musical theaters and classical music. I go to classical music concerts and musical shows almost weekly. My favorite composer is Antonio Vivaldi.
